'''
A Node represents any reachable point in the RoboUber world. Nodes can be thought of as lying on a
square grid with all the cardinal compass points being adjacent - i.e. the diagonals as well as 
the sides are accessible. A Node has a certain maximum occupancy (in terms of taxis). Any taxis
above the occupancy limit must wait until a space in the Node has been vacated. We allow more
than one occupant at some points to prevent there being a bottleneck at major junctions (nodes
with high in-degree). For simplicity we require that only one taxi per direction can ever be
present in a Node.
To simulate traffic, there are several flow control properties and methods built into a Node. 
Taxis must attempt to access a Node using indicate(). This signals intent to occupy the Node.
Taxis can abandon the attempt at any time using free(). When capacity becomes available, the
Node uses the traffic_light property to signal which taxi in the waiting list gains access.
Taxis must poll the traffic_light to see if they can enter, which they then do by using
occupy(). A taxi leaves a node using vacate() (which will, of course, only be possible if
the node it's moving to has space). 
There is also a traffic property, that the taxi can interrogate, which is a simple representation
of the overall (i.e. non-taxi) traffic in the Node. The amount of traffic in the node indicates
how many time steps are necessary to vacate the Node. If traffic reaches 5 (gridlock), the taxi
cannot vacate until traffic drops below 5.
There is a stop_allowed property. Fares can only be present at a node if stop is allowed. There
will only ever be one fare at a given stop (to minimise management of fare allocation). A taxi
can always opt simply to stop at a given location, but if stop is not allowed, it must not.

          These methods allow the taxi to move between Nodes using drive. There are 3 steps.
          First, the taxi makes a decision to turn or continue straight through (if it can).
          Then, it must indicate to the Node that it is turning (and it can abandon the attempt
          if it waited too long).
          Finally, it vacates its old Node and occupies the new one.
