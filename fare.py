'''
A Fare is a very simple object residing in the world, representing a passenger to be delivered to some
destination starting from some origin. Fares wait for a taxi for a finite amount of time, given by 
maxWait, which is not known to the dispatcher or taxis, then abandon their request. Fares 'live' in a
queue ordered by abandon time, which is popped at each time step and sent to the dispatcher as a cancelled
fare. Meanwhile, they likewise appear at their origin nodes at random times - an event also given to the
dispatcher. They have a few simple methods which do the more or less obvious things: collecting and
dropping them off and assigning a price.
