NetWorld is the main class responsible for driving the simulation. It contains the road network
graph, the time-stepper, and the controller that deals with taxi and dispatcher commands. Notionally,
a time step is a minute of 'real time', but it could, in principle, be almost anything. The 
graph is a map of Nodes, each of which lies at some (x,y) coordinate.

      runtime - number of  time steps in the simulation (0 = run forever)
      fareprob - A default fare probability generator can be specified, this should
      be a Python callable object similar to the Node's fare probability generator
